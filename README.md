### Current Issues
- Still a bit messy in relation to routes
- No styling

Working:
  - User can peep
    - Peep is stored in database
  - Sign Up
    - User can sign up
    - Fails if invalid email is entered

```
Technical Approach:
-----

In this unit, you integrated a database into Bookmark Manager using the `PG` gem and `SQL` queries. You can continue to use this approach when building Chitter Challenge.

If you'd like more technical challenge now, try using an [Object Relational Mapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) as the database interface.

Some useful resources:
**DataMapper**
- [Datamapper wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataMapper)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & DataMapper recipe](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-recipes/blob/master/databases/postgresql-datamapper.md)

**Ruby Object Mapper**
- [ROM](https://rom-rb.org/)

**ActiveRecord**
- [ActiveRecord ORM](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Sinatra, PostgreSQL & ActiveRecord recipe](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/databases/postgresql-activerecord?#article)

Notes on functionality:
------

* You don't have to be logged in to see the peeps.
* Makers sign up to chitter with their email, password, name and a username (e.g. samm@makersacademy.com, password123, Sam Morgan, sjmog).
* The username and email are unique.
* Peeps (posts to chitter) have the name of the maker and their user handle.
* Your README should indicate the technologies used, and give instructions on how to install and run the tests.

Bonus:
-----

If you have time you can implement the following:

* In order to start a conversation as a maker I want to reply to a peep from another maker.

And/Or:

* Work on the CSS to make it look good.
